This is the library for custom components that are used in the project. It is a separate library so that it can be
shared between the different projects. This library is built using React and CSS for styling. There is strong emphasis
placed on avoiding the use of external libraries to keep the bundle size small and to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
Heavy inspiration was drawn from the [https://www.alignui.com](Align UI) library for the design of the components.
